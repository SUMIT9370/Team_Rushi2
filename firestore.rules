/**
 * This ruleset establishes a security model based on user ownership.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is built on the principle of least privilege. Users have
 * strict control over their own data and cannot see or modify anyone else's.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: This collection stores the primary data for each user.
 *   Access is strictly controlled by matching the authenticated user's ID
 *   with the {userId} in the document path.
 * - /users/{userId}/emergencyContacts/{contactId}: This subcollection stores
 *   emergency contacts for a user. Access is inherited from the parent user
 *   document, ensuring only the user can manage their contacts.
 * - /users/{userId}/familyMembers/{memberId}: This subcollection stores
 *   family members. Access is inherited from the parent user document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Data Privacy: Users can only create, read, update, or delete their
 *   own user document and subcollections. They cannot view other users' data.
 * - Secure Data Creation: Rules enforce that the `id` field of a new user
 *   document matches the auth `uid`, preventing identity spoofing.
 * - Immutable User ID: The user ID field cannot be changed after creation.
 * - Default Deny: Any operation not explicitly permitted is denied.
